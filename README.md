# DD2391 Project Final 18

## Meeting 2025-09-10

Meeting in-person with Robert at 13.00 on Tuesday. We'll meet a little bit earlier to decide on which our primary project idea will be.

Ideas:

* Performing a web attack --- Ioanna
* Network of docker containers, exploring firewalls --- Alex
* Exploiting CVE (demonstration / e.g. Spectre) --- Eskil, Ioanna
* Implement antivirus that identifies malware --- Elias

Lab format if original idea is not too difficult.

Deadline for topic research Monday at 19.00
